# HNB_Contracts

HybridNetworkBridge provides the latest and comprehensive asset cross-chain exchange program to support the conversion of
assets on mainstream public chains such as ETH, HECO, BSC, ONT to the demand side to solve the pain point that the asset swap
chain can only be carried out through the central exchange.

At the same time, in order to meet the diversified needs, the chain records the history service by calling the contract, and the order matching contract and aggregation contract work together to realize the complete closed-loop system of the whole network.
